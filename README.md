# Metro-System-using-Dijkstra-in-Cpp
This is a Data Structure Course project that used Graph algorithms (mainly Dijkstra ) to calculate the shortest path for a metro bus using the theoretical calculations techniques. It also includes a Management System for the execution and deployment with use Queues and Stacks.
